# Overview

`magnetron` will contain reusable and tested core components of the microtonal synthesizer [`microwave`](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/tree/master/microwave).

So far, `magnetron` provides a very basic architecture for creating custom audio processors and automations. Over time, the design will solidify and predefined audio processors and automations will be added.
