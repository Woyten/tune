Create your own modular microtonal synthesizer from reusable building blocks.

# Overview

`magnetron` will contain reusable and tested core components of the microtonal synthesizer [microwave](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/tree/main/microwave).

As of now, `magnetron` provides a very basic architecture for creating custom audio processors and automations. Over time, the design will solidify and predefined audio processors and automations will be added.
