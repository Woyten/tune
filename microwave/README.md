# Overview

`microwave` is a microtonal modular waveform synthesizer with soundfont rendering capabilities based on:

- [tune](https://github.com/Woyten/tune) &ndash; a microtonal library
- [magnetron](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/tree/master/magnetron) &ndash; a modular synthesizer architecture
- [fluid-xenth](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/tree/master/fluid-xenth) &ndash; a microtonal soundfont renderer
- [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) &ndash; a graphics and game engine

It features a virtual piano UI enabling you to play polyphonic microtonal melodies with your touch screen, computer keyboard, MIDI keyboard or mouse. The UI provides information about pitches and just intervals in custom tuning systems.

The built-in modular synthesis engine does not use any fixed architecture and can be customized to react to all sorts of input events.

# Download / Installation

Option A: Try out the web app to get a very first impression:

- [microwave (Browser)](https://woyten.github.io/microwave) - Very experimental!

Option B: Download a precompiled version of `microwave` for the supported target architectures:

- [microwave 0.34.0 (Linux)](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/releases/download/microwave-0.34.0/microwave-0.34.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip)
- [microwave 0.34.0 (Windows)](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/releases/download/microwave-0.34.0/microwave-0.34.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)
- [microwave 0.34.0 (macOS)](https://github.com/Woyten/tune/releases/download/microwave-0.34.0/microwave-0.34.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip)

Option C: Use Cargo to build a fresh binary from scratch for your own target architecture:

```bash
# If you are using Linux: Make sure all dev dependencies are installed.
# On the CI environment (Ubuntu 20.04) we only need to add two dev dependencies:
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libudev-dev

# Make sure pkg-config is installed
sudo apt install pkg-config

cargo install -f microwave
```

`microwave` should run out-of-the box on a recent (Ubuntu) Linux, Windows or macOS installation. If it doesn't, the problem is probably caused by the Bevy framework. In that case, try following these [instructions](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/).

# Usage

Hint: Run `microwave` with parameters from a shell environment (Bash, PowerShell). Double-clicking on the executable will not provide access to all features!

```bash
microwave run                       # 12-EDO scale (default)
microwave run steps 1:22:2          # 22-EDO scale
microwave run scl-file my_scale.scl # imported scale
microwave run help                  # Print help about how to set the parameters to start microwave
```

This should spawn a window displaying a virtual keyboard. Use your touch screen, computer keyboard or mouse to play melodies on the virtual piano.

## Profiles

On startup, `microwave` tries to load a profile specified by the `-p` / `--profile` parameter or the `MICROWAVE_PROFILE` environment variable. If no such file is found `microwave` will create a default profile for you.

The profile has the following structure:

```yaml
num_buffers:        # Number of main audio buffers
audio_buffers:      # Audio buffers that are played back by the main audio device
waveform_templates: # Named templates to be used by the Magnetron synthesizer
waveform_envelopes: # Named envelopes to be used by the Magnetron synthesizer
effect_templates:   # Named templates to be used by the effect processors
stages:             # Stages that can create or process audio or MIDI data
```

### `waveform_templates` Section

The purpose of the `waveform_templates` section of the config file is to define the most important LF sources s.t. they do not have to be redefined over and over again. But what are LF sources?

#### LF Sources

Almost all stage parameters are real numbers that can update in real-time. To keep the audio engine performant updates are usually evaluated at a much lower rate than the audio sampling rate. LF sources, therefore, add control and expressiveness to your playing but aren't well suited for spectral modulation.

To define LF sources the following data types can be used:

- Numbers, e.g.
  ```yml
  frequency: 440.0
  ```
- Strings referring to a named template, e.g.
  ```yml
  frequency: WaveformPitch
  ```
- Nested LF source expressions, e.g.
  ```yml
  frequency: { Mul: [ 2.0, WaveformPitch ] }
  ```
  or (using indented style)
  ```yml
  frequency:
    Mul:
      - 2.0
      - WaveformPitch
  ```

Unfortunately, no detailed LF source documentation is available yet. However, the example profile, `microwave`'s error messages and basic YAML knowledge should enable you to find valid LF source expressions.

#### LF Source Example &ndash; Using Pitch-Bend Events

Inspecting the default profile the following template definition can be found:

```yml
waveform_templates:
  - name: WaveformPitch
    value:
      Mul:
        - Property:
            kind: WaveformPitch
        - Semitones:
            Controller:
              kind: PitchBend
              map0: 0.0
              map1: 2.0
```

The given fragment defines a template with name `WaveformPitch` which provides values by reading the waveform's `WaveformPitch` property and multiplying it with the pitch-bend wheel's value in whole tones.

This means reacting to pitch-bend events is not a hardcoded feature of `microwave` but a behavior that the user can define by themself!

#### LF Source Example &ndash; Using the Damper Pedal

Another important template from the default profile is the following one:

```yml
waveform_templates:
  - name: Fadeout
    value:
      Controller:
        kind: Damper
        map0:
          Property:
            kind: OffVelocitySet
        map1: 0.0
```

The given template provides a value describing to what extent a waveform is supposed to be faded out. It works in the following way:

While a key is pressed down, `OffVelocitySet` resolves to 0.0. As a result, `Controller`, as well, resolves to 0.0, regardless of the damper pedal state. Therefore, the waveform remains stable.

As soon as a key is released, `OffVelocitySet` will resolve to 1.0. Now, `Controller` will interpolate between 0.0 (damper pedal pressed) and 1.0 (damper pedal released). As a consequence, the waveform will fade out unless the damper pedal is pressed.

Like in the example before, reacting to the damper pedal is not a hardcoded feature built into `microwave` but customizable behavior.

#### LF Source Example &ndash; Volume Control

A third important predefined template addresses volume control:

```yml
waveform_templates:
  - name: WaveformOut
    value:
      Mul:
        - Controller:
            kind: Volume
            map0: 0.0
            map1: 0.1
        - Property:
            kind: Velocity
```

It works by multiplying the value of the volume controller with the velocity of the pressed key s.t. the synthesizer reacts as expected.

#### How to Access tha Templates

Just provide the name of the template as a single string argument. Examples:

```yml
frequency: WaveformPitch
fadeout: Fadeout
out_levels: [WaveformOut, WaveformOut]
```

### `waveform_envelopes` Section

Every waveform needs to refer to an envelope defined in the `waveform_envelopes` section of the config file. Envelopes transfer the result of the internal waveform buffers to the main audio pipeline and limit the waveform's lifetime.

An envelope definition typically looks like the following:

```yml
waveform_envelopes:
  - name: Piano
    fadeout: Fadeout
    attack_time: 0.01
    decay_rate: 1.0
    release_time: 0.25
    in_buffer: 7
    out_buffers: [0, 1]
    out_levels: [WaveformOut, WaveformOut]
```

with

- `name`: The name of the envelope.
- `fadeout`: Defines the amount by which the waveform should fade out. **Important:** If this value is set to constant 0.0 the waveform will never fade out and continue to consume CPU resources, eventually leading to an overload of the audio thread.
- `attack_time`: The linear attack time in seconds.
- `decay_rate`: The exponential decay rate in 1/seconds (inverse half-life) after the attack phase is over.
- `release_time`: The linear release time in seconds. The waveform is considered exhausted as soon as the integral over `fadeout / release_time * dt` reaches 1.0.
- `in_buffer`: The buffer that is supposed to be transferred to the main audio pipeline
- `out_buffers`: The (stereo) buffers of the main audio pipeline that the signal in `in_buffer` is supposed to be written to
- `out_levels`: The amplitude factor to apply when writing to the main audio pipeline. It makes sense to use `WaveformOut` as a value but the user can choose whatever LF source expression they find useful.

### `effect_templates` Section

This section is completely analogous to the `waveform_templates` section but it is dedicated to work in combination with the `Effect` stages documented below.

### Magnetron Synthesizer &ndash; Create Your Own Waveforms

To enable the modular `Magnetron` synthesizer add the following stage:

```yaml
stages:
  - Magnetron:
      num_buffers: # Number of waveform audio buffers
      waveforms:   # Waveform definitions
```

#### `waveforms` Section

The `waveforms` section defines the waveform render stages to be applied sequentially when a waveform is triggered.

You can mix and match as many stages as you want to create the tailored sound you wish for. The following example config defines a clavinettish sounding waveform that I discovered by accident:

```yml
waveforms:
  - name: Funky Clavinet
    envelope: Piano
    stages:
      - Oscillator:
          kind: Sin
          frequency: WaveformPitch
          modulation: None
          out_buffer: 0
          out_level: 440.0
      - Oscillator:
          kind: Triangle
          frequency: WaveformPitch
          modulation: ByFrequency
          mod_buffer: 0
          out_buffer: 1
          out_level: 1.0
      - Filter:
          kind: HighPass2
          resonance:
            Mul:
              - WaveformPitch
              - Time:
                  start: 0.0
                  end: 0.1
                  from: 2.0
                  to: 4.0
          quality: 5.0
          in_buffer: 1
          out_buffer: AudioOut
          out_level: 1.0
```

While rendering the sound three stages are applied:

1. Generate a sine wave with the waveform's nominal frequency *F* and an amplitude of 440. Write this waveform to buffer 0.
1. Generate a triangle wave with frequency *F* and an amplitude of 1.0. Modulate the waveform's frequency (in Hz) sample-wise by the amount stored in buffer 0. Write the modulated waveform to buffer 1.
1. Apply a second-order high-pass filter to the samples stored in buffer 1. The high-pass's resonance frequency rises from 2*F* to 4*F* within 0.1 seconds. Write the result to `AudioOut`.

To create your own waveforms use the default config file as a starting point and try editing it by trial-and-error. Let `microwave`'s error messages guide you to find valid configurations.

### Fluid Synthesizer

For playback of sampled sounds you need to add a `Fluid` stage to the stages section.

The following example starts up a `Fluid` stage reading the soundfont located at the given location. The rendered audio will be written to the audio buffers `0` and `1` of the main audio pipeline.

```yaml
stages:
  - Fluid:
      soundfont_location: <soundfont-location>
      out_buffers: [0, 1]
```

If you like to use compressed sf3 files you need to compile `microwave` with the `sf3` feature enabled. Note that the startup will take significantly longer since the soundfont needs to be decompressed first.

### Effects &ndash; Create Your Own Effects

To add your own customizable effects add an effect stage. The following config will add a rotary-speaker effect stage to the main audio pipeline.


```yaml
stages:
  - Effect:
      RotarySpeaker:
        buffer_size: 100000
        gain:
          Controller:
            kind: Sound9
            map0: 0.0
            map1: 0.5
        rotation_radius: 20.0
        speed:
          Fader:
            movement:
              Controller:
                kind: Sound10
                map0: -2.0
                map1: 1.0
            map0: 1.0
            map1: 7.0
        in_buffers: [4, 5]
        out_buffers: [14, 15]
```

The given config defines the following properties:

- `buffer_size`: A fixed delay buffer size of 100000 samples
- `gain`: An input gain ranging from 0.0 to 0.5. The input gain can be controlled via the F9 key or MIDI CCN 78.
- `rotation_radius`: A rotation radius of 20 cm
- `speed`: A rotation speed ranging from 1 Hz to 7 Hz. The selected speed is determined by the `Fader` component which will gradually fade between the two values. The movement of the fader is controlled by the the F10 key or MIDI CCN 79 and ranges from -2.0/s to 1.0/s in order to simulate the rotary speaker's acceleration/deceleration.
- `in_buffers`: Buffers 4 and 5 are used as effect inputs
- `out_buffers`: Buffers 14 and 15 are used as effect outputs

### MIDI Out

To enable playback through an external MIDI device add the following stage to the audio pipeline:

```yaml
stages:
  - MidiOut:
      out_device: <midi-device>
      out_channel: 0
      num_out_channels: 9
      device_id: 127
      tuning_program: 0
      tuning_method: <tuning-method>
```
The available tuning methods are `full`, `full-rt`, `octave-1`, `octave-1-rt`, `octave-2`, `octave-2-rt`, `fine-tuning` and `pitch-bend`.

To retrieve a list of available MIDI devices run:

```bash
microwave devices
```

## Command Line Parameters

The command-line enables you to set set up sample rates, buffer sizes and other startup parameters. To print a full list of available command-line arguments run:

```bash
microwave run help
```

### MIDI In

To listen for events originating from an external MIDI device you need to specify the name of the input device:

```bash
microwave devices # List MIDI devices
microwave run --midi-in name-of-my-device
microwave run --midi-in "name of my device" # If the device name contains spaces
```

## Live Interactions

You can live-control your waveforms and effects with your mouse pointer, touch pad or any MIDI Control Change messages source.

The following example stage defines a resonating low-pass filter whose resonance frequency can be controlled with a MIDI modulation wheel/lever from 0 to 10,000 Hz.

```yml
Filter:
  kind: LowPass2
  resonance:
    Controller:
      kind: Modulation
      map0: 0.0
      map1: 10000.0
  quality: 5.0
  in_buffer: 0
  out_buffer: AudioOut
  out_level: 1.0
```

If you want to use the mouse's vertical axis for sound control use the `Breath` controller.

```yml
resonance:
  Controller:
    kind: Breath
    map0: 0.0
    map1: 10000.0
```

If you want to use the touchpad for polyphonic sound control use the `KeyPressure` template.

```yml
resonance:
  Linear:
    input: KeyPressure
    map0: 0.0
    map1: 10000.0
```
